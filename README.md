# --courier-


Here is my first application made in JAVA FX. (revised version after the total code refactor). A short description 
of the function until the screenshots are inserted.
1. We play the role of a courier who dispatches packages.
2. We have a panel where information such as: 
- our speed 
- mileage
- fuel condition 
- range in kilometers 
- the amount of money is displayed
3. Buttons deliver a package that opens us a new window with a selection of short, medium, long routes (they are generated randomly), 
and when we accept the choice creates a window informing how many kilometers are left to drive, to complete the route and how 
much money we get.
4. Button driveToGasStation thanks to which we will go to a petrol station in order to refuel (fuel price generated randomly at every visit).
5. Of course, start, stop, gas and break.
